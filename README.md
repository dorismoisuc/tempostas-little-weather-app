# tempostas-little-weather-app

This is a little weather app, TEMPOSTAS, showing the weather from all around the world. 
I used: https://openweathermap.org/
api created by using python.

It displays: 

● the town and its country

● temperature in celsius, kelvin and fahrenheit

● 2 atmospheric conditions: main and secondary

Things I could improve at my app:

● the search getting results faster

If the location entered doesn't exist, it displays a message.
Also has an info window.
I created it as an executable too.

Enjoy! xD
