# tempostas-little-weather-app

This is a little weather app, tempostas, showing the weather from all around the world. 
I used: https://openweathermap.org/
api created by using python.

It displays: 
● the town and its country
● temperature in celsius, kelvin and fahrenheit
● 2 atmospheric conditions: main and secondary

If the location entered doesn't exist, it displays a message.
Also has a little info window.
